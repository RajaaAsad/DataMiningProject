# DataMiningProject
The Thyroid Disease Data Set is a dataset that contains information about patients with thyroid disease. It includes several columns of data, such as age, sex, thyroid hormone levels, and thyroid disease diagnosis. 
The goal of working with this dataset might be to use machine learning techniques to build a model that can predict thyroid disease diagnosis based on the other columns of data.
The tool we will use is R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and researchers for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
